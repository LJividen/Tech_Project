# Performance Evaluation of Pandas, Polars, and Pyspark
The evaluation of the python packages were performed with two tests on a heterogeneous and a homogeneous dataset.
1) Loading times of each dataset.
2) Profiling performance for a basic profiling step.

- In almost all categories, pandas outperformed the other tasks greatly. Pandas also holds the advantage personally for ease of use due to my familiarity with it.
- Polars mainly suffered in its loading speed of the hetrogeneous dataset where it lagged compared to the others. Elsewhere, its performace was just shadowed by pandas.
- Pyspark fell behind in all but one category, the loading speed of the hetrogeneous dataset. Here, it outperformed the others by a significant margin.
